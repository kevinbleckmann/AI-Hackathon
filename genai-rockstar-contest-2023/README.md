## Agenda

- Introduction to the Intel Generative AI Rockstar Challenge
- Quick review of the [Guidelines](guidelines.md)
- Quick review of what we are providing and the flow


## Environment

You will need an AWS account as this terraform module will launch a M7i.4xlarge instance on AWS. These instances use the latest [Intel 4th Generation Xeon CPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon-accelerated/4th-gen-xeon-scalable-processors.html), which include new accelerators that help speed up AI and other workloads. This event will focus on taking advantage of the [Intel AMX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html) accelerator to do AI inferencing on CPUs.


### Components that will be installed

- [Intel Optimized Cloud Recipes](https://github.com/intel/optimized-cloud-recipes)
- [Intel Extension for PyTorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch)
- [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)

This contest leverages the [Intel Cloud Optimization Modules](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/cloud-optimization.html) to provision the VM. For this event, we are using the [AWS VM Module](https://github.com/intel/terraform-intel-aws-vm).

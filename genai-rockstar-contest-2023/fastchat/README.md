# Generate Song Lyrics

We will be using one of Intel's Optimized Cloud Recipes. If you want to experiment with this on your own, you can find the recipe [here](https://github.com/intel/optimized-cloud-recipes/tree/main/recipes/ai-fastchat-amx-ubuntu).

This recipe is included in the Terraform module.  This installs and configures [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) on the VM created in your AWS account. The [Intel Extension for Pytorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) also deploys onto the VM, along with a few other components, for full details, refer to the recipe.

Intel AMX has been enabled by default.

## Instructions

Run the Terraform Module [gen-ai-fastchat](https://github.com/intel/terraform-intel-aws-vm/tree/main/examples/gen-ai-fastchat)

- The output of completed terraform module should look similar to this
![Successful output example](images/genai-aws-success.png)

- After the module completes you will need to SSH to the public IP of the instance or use AWS Session Manager.
- Run the following command to start FastChat

```Shell
source /usr/local/bin/run_demo.sh
```

If this is successful you will see the following output:

```shell

Lyrics: 

Verse 1:
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
A hero emerged, to save us all from the dark side
He fought against the evil Empire, with a lightsaber in hand
And brought hope to the galaxy, with a wave of his wand

Chorus:
Star Wars, Star Wars, the epic space saga
With heroes and villains, it's a story we all know
From a tiny planet, to the Death Star
The Force is strong, with our Jedi warriors
```
